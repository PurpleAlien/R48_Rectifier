# R48_Rectifier
CAN control of an Emerson/Vertiv R48 Rectifier, such as an R48-3000e3. These kinds of rectifiers are used in telecom equipment etc., but can be repurposed to serve as a cheap LiFePO4 charger in 16s configuration. These kinds of devices are used for this purpose for example in the popular 'Chargeverter' from Signature Solar.

A used and pre-configured R48-3000e3 with adapter interface can be found e.g. on Aliexpress for under €100 shipping included: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeSzqo9
