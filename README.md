# R48_Rectifier
CAN control of an Emerson/Vertiv R48 Rectifier, such as an R48-3000e3. These kinds of rectifiers are used in telecom equipment etc., but can be repurposed to serve as a cheap LiFePO4 battery charger in for example a 16s cell configuration. These kinds of devices are used for this purpose in the popular 'Chargeverter' from Signature Solar.

A used and pre-configured R48-3000e3 (3kW) with adapter interface can be found e.g. on Aliexpress for under â‚¬100 shipping included: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeSzqo9
